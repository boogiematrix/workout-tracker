# workout-tracker
  ## Description
  
   This is basically a workout specific note-taking app. It keeps track of weight lifted and workout duration, and displays the data graphically, allowing you to quickly see any changes in your regimen. Using MongoDB, the workout stats are stored in a non-relational data collection. The ODM used for this project is Mongoose. It's deployed to Heroku with MongoDB Atlas
